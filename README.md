# RC390
This project investigates the braking performance improvements achieved by upgrading a KTM RC390â€™s stock single-disc front brake to a custom dual-disc setup. Using MATLAB simulations, I compared hydraulic and mechanical braking characteristics, maximum deceleration, and stopping distances from 100 km/h
